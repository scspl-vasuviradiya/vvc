# Collection Management System - Localhost Server

## 🎯 **What's Changed**

### ✅ **Full Localhost Functionality**
- **Real File Saving**: Collections save directly to `collections.json`
- **Image Uploads**: Images save directly to `img/collections/` folder
- **No More Browser Storage**: Everything saves to actual files
- **Server Support**: PHP server handles all file operations

### ✅ **Localhost Server Launcher**
- **New**: `Launch-Localhost-Server.bat` file
- **Feature**: Starts local server and opens browser automatically
- **Smart**: Detects Python, PHP, or Node.js and uses the best option

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Method 1: Localhost Server (Recommended)
1. **Double-click** `Launch-Localhost-Server.bat`
2. The server will:
   - Detect available server (Python/PHP/Node.js)
   - Start localhost server on port 8080
   - Open browser to collection management automatically
   - Enable full file saving and image upload functionality

### Method 2: File Mode (Limited Functionality)
1. Open any web browser
2. Open `collection-management.html`
3. **Note**: Only localStorage saving, no file uploads

   ✓ Node.js (http-server) - Also supported

2. Starts the best available server on port 8080

3. Opens browser to: http://localhost:8080/collection-management.html
```

### **Fallback Options**
```
[1] Install Python (Recommended)
[2] Try file:// mode (Limited functionality)
[Q] Quit
```

- Python, PHP, or Node.js (auto-detected)

### **Recommended**
- Python 3.x (simplest setup)
- Google Chrome or Firefox browser

## 🎉 **Ready to Use!**

1. **Double-click** `Launch-Localhost-Server.bat`
2. **Wait** for server to start and browser to open
3. **Start** managing your collections with full functionality!

The localhost server provides full file access - collections save to collections.json and images upload to img/collections/ automatically!

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Server won't start**
- Install Python from python.org (recommended)
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Run as Administrator if needed
- Check Windows execution policies

### **Collections won't save**
- Ensure server is running (keep command window open)
- Check file permissions in project folder
- Look for error messages in browser console (F12)

### **Images won't upload**
- Verify img/collections/ folder exists
- Check image size (must be under 5MB)
- Ensure image format is JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Check server is running on localhost

## 📞 **Support**

The localhost server system provides full functionality with automatic file handling. If you encounter issues:

1. Keep the server command window open while using the system
2. Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages
3. Verify all PHP files and HTML are in the same folder
4. Try different server options (Python → PHP → Node.js)

**Happy collecting with full localhost power! 🎊**
