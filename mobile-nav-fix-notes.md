# Mobile Navigation Fix

## Problem
The mobile navigation hamburger button was not functioning. Clicking the mobile menu toggle button (hamburger menu) did nothing because there was no JavaScript event handler attached to it.

## Root Cause
The HTML structure for mobile navigation was complete with all necessary elements:
- Mobile menu button (`#mobileMenuBtn`)
- Mobile navigation panel (`#mobileNav`) 
- Mobile menu overlay (`#mobileMenuOverlay`)
- Close button (`#mobileNavClose`)

However, the `animations.js` file only contained animation and scroll functionality - it was missing the mobile navigation event handlers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Mobile Navigation Function
Created `initMobileNavigation()` function in `animations.js` with:

- **Element Selection**: Gets references to all mobile navigation elements
- **Open/Close Functions**: 
  - `openMobileMenu()` - Adds 'active' class, prevents body scrolling
  - `closeMobileMenu()` - Removes 'active' class, restores scrolling
- **Event Listeners**:
  - Hamburger button click to toggle menu
  - Close button click to close menu
  - Overlay click to close menu
  - Navigation link clicks to close menu
  - Escape key to close menu
  - Window resize to close menu on desktop breakpoint

### 2. Integrated with Existing System
- Added `initMobileNavigation()` call to both DOMContentLoaded paths
- Maintains consistency with existing code structure
- Uses same IIFE pattern as rest of animations.js

## CSS Classes Used
The fix leverages existing CSS classes:
- `.mobile-nav.active` - Shows navigation panel (right: 0)
- `.mobile-menu-overlay.active` - Shows overlay background
- CSS transitions already handle smooth animations

## Features Added
- ✅ Hamburger button toggles mobile menu
- ✅ Close button closes mobile menu  
- ✅ Clicking overlay closes mobile menu
- ✅ Clicking nav links closes mobile menu
- ✅ Escape key closes mobile menu
- ✅ Window resize closes menu on desktop
- ✅ Body scroll prevention when menu open
- ✅ Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Resize to mobile width (< 1024px) or use mobile device
3. Click the hamburger menu button - menu should slide in from right
4. Test all close methods (close button, overlay, nav links, escape key)
5. Verify menu closes automatically when resizing to desktop width

## Files Modified
- `animations.js` - Added mobile navigation functionality (60+ lines of code)
